# ‚ùå Former Crate Deprecated
This crate is deprecated. Please use the new crate [firecracker-rs-sdk](https://github.com/xuehaonan27/firecracker-rs-sdk) instead.

It's worth noting that [rustcracker](https://github.com/xuehaonan27/rustcracker) has been deprecated. 

The original deprecated library had been a useful tool in the past, but due to various reasons such as lack of maintenance, compatibility issues with the latest Rust ecosystem and Firecracker versions, I decided to create this new library.

I've carefully migrated the core functional components, improved the code structure, and added new features to better serve the needs of developers working with Firecracker in Rust projects. With this SDK, developers can easily start, manage, and control Firecracker instances using Rust code, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying Firecracker API and providing a more intuitive and Rustic programming experience.
