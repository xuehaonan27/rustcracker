/*
Vsock Defines a vsock device, backed by a set of Unix Domain Sockets, on the host side.

For host-initiated connections, Firecracker will be
listening on the Unix socket identified by the path `uds_path`.
Firecracker will create this socket, bind and listen on it.

Host-initiated connections will be performed by connection
to this socket and issuing a connection forwarding
request to the desired guest-side vsock port
(i.e. `CONNECT 52\n`, to connect to port 52).

For guest-initiated connections, Firecracker will expect host
software to be bound and listening on Unix sockets at `uds_path_<PORT>`.
E.g. "/path/to/host_vsock.sock_52" for port number 52.
